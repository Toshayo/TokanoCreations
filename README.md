# Tokano Creations Mod

This mod is based on [@tokachan5656](https://twitter.com/tokachan5656)'s
characters (currently only Ideal-chan). The mod currently adds
3d modelled Ideal-chan's sword (you can see it on
[this artwork](https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/97032053)).

Tokano Creations Mod has an integration with Thaumcraft 4.2.3.5.
A new research is added in Basics category. There is some references
to the character setting (you can find the full version of it on
[this post](https://twitter.com/tokachan5656/status/1489259520325201921))

Without Thaumcraft, you can use [NEI](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/notenoughitems)
to view recipes. However, the recipe of combining the clock with the hair
strand will not be visible.

An item used in the sword craft is gotten on a game event.
The hint is hidden in the character setting (the link is given above). :)

## Known problems
I suppose the japanese translations being very inaccurate because
I've translated them with Google Translate. Though I tried to
make phrases rather simple, and I've checked the reverse
translation, but it is still not ideal.

## Mod usage
The mod has been developed for myself and for the artist,
so I would like you to ask me if you want to use the mod in a
modpack. (Discord : @Toshayo#5540)
