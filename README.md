# Tokano Creations Mod

This mod is based on [@tokachan5656](https://twitter.com/tokachan5656)'s
characters (currently only Ideal-chan). The mod currently adds
3d modelled Ideal-chan's sword (you can see it on
[this artwork](https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/97032053)), cross (seen on [this one](https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/115402066) and some drafts)
and some other stuff related to the character.

Tokano Creations Mod has an integration with Thaumcraft 4.2.3.5.
New researches are added in Basics category. There is some references
to the character setting (you can find the full version of it on
[this post](https://twitter.com/tokachan5656/status/1489259520325201921))

There is also more stuff added with TravellersGear installed.

Without Thaumcraft, you can use [NEI](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/notenoughitems)
to view recipes. However, some recipes might be not visible.

## Known problems
Japanese localization is machine translation, so it can be very inaccurate. Though I tried to
make phrases rather simple, and I've cross-checked the translation, but it is still not ideal.

## Mod usage
The mod has been developed for myself and for the artist,
so if you want to use the mod in a modpack,
I would be glad if you notify me. (Discord : toshayo)
