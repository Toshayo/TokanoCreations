# Tokano Creations Mod

This mod is based on [@tokachan5656](https://twitter.com/tokachan5656)'s
characters (currently only Ideal-chan). The mod currently adds
3d modelled Ideal-chan's sword (you can see it on
[this artwork](https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/97032053)) and some other stuff related to the character.

Some events happen based on character's lore.

## Known problems
Japanese localization is machine translation, so it can be very inaccurate. Though I tried to
make phrases rather simple, and I've cross-checked the translation, but it is still not ideal.

## Mod usage
The mod has been developed for myself and for the artist,
so if you want to use the mod in a modpack,
I would be glad if you notify me. (Discord : toshayo)
